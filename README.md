# Assignment 1: User admin, Login, Register, and Profile
Here you will find code for building a simple User login, register, profile access and admin
functionality for an online course manager site named Whiteboard.

The stack is:
- HTML, CSS/Bootstrap, JS for client side-
- AJAX for web service HTTP requests
- Java/SQL for server side data handling using the Java Persistence Library

The web app is hosted by Heroku and can be found
[here](https://eh-cs4550-summer2-2018.herokuapp.com/jquery/register/register.template.client.html)

Hope you enjoy and more is to come with future React and Node implementation.
